# Number Guessing Game 🎲

This is my Task 1 at InternPE, where I created a number guessing game using Java.

## About the Game 🎮
This is a simple number guessing game where the computer selects a random number between a specified range, and the player has to guess that number within a certain number of attempts.

## How to Play 
1. The computer will randomly select a number between a specified range.
2. You need to guess the number within a certain number of attempts.
3. After each guess, the computer will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or run out of attempts.

## Technologies Used ⚙️
- Java

## How to Run 
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `NumberGuessingGame.java` file.
